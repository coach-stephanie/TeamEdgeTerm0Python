	# Just from knowing those two topics, you can do so much!
	
	# Let's try to make a simple program that responds to the user.
	# We're going to recreate the Magic 8 Ball!!!
			
			# Never heard of it? That's ok!

					# You got this!

  # -------------------------------------------- 

	# How a Magic 8 Ball Works:

	# The user asks a question and vigoriously shakes the ball. 
	# Then the ball will respond with one of twenty responses, chosen at random. 

	# That's pretty simple right?

 # -------------------------------------------- 

	# Part 1: 
	# Print instructions on the screen and 
	# prompt the user to ask a question

	# Part 2: Next, we need to randomly select a response from 20 options.

	# Randomly select a number from 0 - 19 
	# Use that to select from the following responses:
		# 0 - 
		# 1 - 
		# 2 - 
		# 3 - 
		# 4 - 
		# 5 - 
		# 6 - 
		# 7 -

		# 13 - 
		# 14 - 
		# 15 - 
		# 16 - 
		# 17 - 
		# 18 - 
		# 19 - 

	# Look up random.rand_int to see how you can use it to select a random number.
