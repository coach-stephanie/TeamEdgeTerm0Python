# -------------------------------------------- 

	# You've just learned about variables, conditionals.
	# Just from knowing those two topics, you can do so much!
	
	# Let's try to make a simple program that responds to the user.
	# We're going to recreate the Magic 8 Ball!!!
			
			# Never heard of it? That's ok!

					# You got this!

  # -------------------------------------------- 

	# How a Magic 8 Ball Works:

	# The user asks a question and vigoriously shakes the ball. 
	# Then the ball will respond with one of twenty responses, chosen at random. 

	# That's pretty simple right?

 # -------------------------------------------- 

	# Part 1: 
	# Print instructions on the screen and 
	# prompt the user to ask a question

	

  # --------------------------------------------

print("How a Magic 8 Ball works:")
print("The user asks a question and vigorously shakes the ball.")
print("Then the ball gives the user gets a fortune")













# -------------------------------------------- 

	# Part 2: Next, we need to randomly select a response from 20 options.

	# Randomly select a number from 0 - 19       
	# Use that to select from the following responses:
	select=random.randrange(1,20)
