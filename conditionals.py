# One of the most common parts of our daily routine is checking the weather. 
# Our outfit and accessories are dependent on the temperature and conditions outside. 
# ie. We're probably not going to wear shorts out when it's snowing...

# **** Challenge 3: Part 1 ****
# Write a conditional statement that checks the value of the weather variable 
# and prints out a weather report based on the current weather:
# Rainy: Bring an umbrella
# Sunny: Wear a hat and sunglasses
# Snowing: Wear gloves and a scarf 

# Here's a variable to get you started:
weather = "sunny"

if weather == "rainy":
   print("Wear a raincoat and get an umbrella!")

elif weather == "sunny":
   print("Wear some shorts and avoid long sleeves!")

elif weather == "snowy":
   print("Get your snow boots and coat")

else:
   print("Hope you have a good day!")


# Tip: Try changing the value of the weather variable to test your other conditions.

# **** Challenge 3: Part 2 ****
# Now that you've written conditions for specific weather forecasts, let's also add in temperature! 
# You can't dress accordingly if you only know that it's raining outside but not how cold it is!
# For example:
    # If it's raining and 60 degrees, you might want to bring your umbrella and wear a light jacket.
    # However, if it's raining and 30 degrees, you might want to break out a warmer jacket with your umbrella instead. 
    
   # Add to your conditional statements above and modify your weather reports to also take into account the temperature. 
   # Make sure to account for at least three different temperatures!
   # Hint: You will need another variable to keep track of the temperature.


weather = "rainy"
temp = 40

if weather == "rainy" and temp >= 70:
   print("Get an umbrella and wear short sleeves!")

elif weather == "rainy" and temp <= 70:
   print("Get an umbrella and wear long sleeves or a coat!")

elif weather == "sunny" and temp >= 70:
   print("Wear some shorts and avoid long sleeves!")

elif weather == "snowy" and temp <= 69:
   print("Get your snow boots and coat! It is very cool out!")

else:

# Prompt the user to enter the day of the week (1-7 representing Monday - Sunday)

# A leap year is a calendar year that contains an additional day added 
# to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical year or seasonal year.
# To calculate if a specific year is/was a leap year, you can follow the following steps:
     # 1. If the year is evenly divisible by 4, go to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 5.
     # 2. If the year is evenly divisible by 100, go to step 3. Otherwise, go to step 4.
     # 3. If the year is evenly divisible by 400, go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5.
     # 4. The year is a leap year (it has 366 days).
     # 5. The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days).

# Those are a lot of conditions...
# Your challenge is to translate the steps above into conditionals which will evaluate if the 
# year stored in a variable is/was a leap year.
