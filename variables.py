# Day 1 Challenges: 
# -------------------------------------------- 

# Example
message = "Hello World!"
print(message)

# -------------------------------------------- 
# Challenge 1:
# 
# Imagine it's the first day of class. (Wait, it is the first day isn't it..Deja vu?) 
# Everyone's participating in an icebreaker and has to introduce themselves. 
# It goes something like:
# (Hint: Remove the # signs in front of the print statements below so your code will run!)
# -------------------------------------------- 

print("\n------------------- Challenge 1 -------------------\n")

name = "Happy"
grade = 9 
funFact = "i like to go swimming"

print(f"Hi! My name is {name}")
print(f"I'm in the {grade}th grade.")
print(f"A fun fact about me is that {funFact}")


# **** Upchallenge! ****
# Can you also print out the data type of the variables? 


print ("happy birthday to you")
print ("happy birthday to you")
print ("happy birthday to you")


food = "chicken nugget"
print(f"i am a {food}")


# -------------------------------------------- 
# Challenge 2: 
# Below is a set of problems to help you solidify your understanding of math operators
# Write your solution code under each commented problem. 
# -------------------------------------------- 

print("\n------------------- Challenge 2 -------------------\n")

# Here are some variables to get you started
num1 = 5
num2 = 10
num3 = num1+num2
print (num3)

num4 = 7
num5 = num3-num4
print (num5)


num6 = 3
num7= num5*num6 
print (num7)

print (num7**2)

print (num8/4)

print (num9%2)

# **** Upchallenge! ****
# Given a variable that stores a number, print the values that come right before and right after.
# For example, given the number 4, the program should print 3 and 5. 
# Your code should work even if the value of the variable is changed.

num = 9
