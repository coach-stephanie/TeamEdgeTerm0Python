# Day 1 Challenges: 
# -------------------------------------------- 

# Example
message = "Hello World!"
print(message)

# -------------------------------------------- 
# Challenge 1:
# 
# Imagine it's the first day of class. (Wait, it is the first day isn't it..Deja vu?) 
# Everyone's participating in an icebreaker and has to introduce themselves. 
# It goes something like:
# (Hint: Remove the # signs in front of the print statements below so your code will run!)
# -------------------------------------------- 

print("\n------------------- Challenge 1 -------------------\n")
name = 'JC' 
grade = 10 
funFact = 'I like to play video games' 
print(f"Hi! My name is {name}", type(str))
print(f"I'm in the {grade}th grade.", type(str))
print(f"A fun fact about me is that {funFact}", type(str))



# **** Challenge 1: Problem 1 ****
# Initialize the variables used in the {} with your data for the three statements above! 
# Hint: Also think about where you would initialize those variables


# **** Upchallenge! ****
# Can you also print out the data type of the variables? 




print(' **** Challenge 1: Problem 2 ****')
# Create a string for the different lines of the Happy Birthday Song
# Print out the song using the strings you declared.

you = 'Joseph'
print('Happy Birthday to You')
print('Happy Birthday to You')
print(f'Happy Birthday Dear {you}')
print('Happy Birthday to You.')
print('From good friends and true,')
print('From old friends and new,')
print('May good luck go with you,')
print('And happiness too.')


# **** Challenge 1: Problem 3 ****
# Print out a string that has brackets in it.




# -------------------------------------------- 
# Challenge 2: 
# Below is a set of problems to help you solidify your understanding of math operators
# Write your solution code under each commented problem. 
# -------------------------------------------- 

print("\n------------------- Challenge 2 -------------------\n")

# Here are some variables to get you started
num1 = 5
num2 = 10

# **** Challenge 2: Problem 1 ****
# Store the sum of num1 and num2 in a variable.
# Print the sum.

num3 = 10 + 5

print(num3)

# **** Challenge 2: Problem 2 ****
# Store the difference between sum (above) and 7 in a variable.
# Print the difference.

num4 = 15 - 7

print(num4)

# **** Challenge 2: Problem 3 ****
# Store the product of the difference and 3 in a variable.
# Print the product.

num5 = num4 * 3

print(num5)

# **** Challenge 2: Problem 4 ****
# Store the power of the product squared in a variable.
# Print the power.

num6 = pow(24, 2)

print(num6)

# **** Challenge 2: Problem 5 ****
# Store the quotient of the power divided by 4 in a variable.
# Print the quotient.

num7 = num6/4

print(num7)

# **** Challenge 2: Problem 6 ****
# Store the remainder of the quotient divided by 2 in a variable.
# Print the remainder.

num8 = num7%2

print(num8)

# **** Upchallenge! ****
# Given a variable that stores a number, print the values that come right before and right after.
# For example, given the number 4, the program should print 3 and 5. 
# Your code should work even if the value of the variable is changed.

num = 9
